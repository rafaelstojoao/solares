        A parallel file downloader using asyncio.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        parfive works by creating a downloader object, appending files to it and then
        running the download. parfive has a synchronous API, but uses asyncio to
        paralellise downloading the files.
        
        A simple example is::
        
          from parfive import Downloader
        
          dl = Downloader()
        
          dl.enqueue_file("http://data.sunpy.org/sample-data/predicted-sunspot-radio-flux.txt", path="./")
        
          files = dl.download()
        
        
        Results
        ^^^^^^^
        
        ``parfive.Downloader.download`` returns a ``parfive.Results`` object, which is a
        list of the filenames that have been downloaded. It also tracks any files which
        failed to download.
        
        
        Handling Errors
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        If files fail to download, the urls and the response from the server are stored
        in the ``Results`` object returned by ``parfive.Downloader``. These can be used to
        inform users about the errors. (Note, the progress bar will finish in an
        incomplete state if a download fails, i.e. it will show ``4/5 Files Downloaded``).
        
        The ``Results`` object is a list with an extra attribute ``errors``, this property
        returns a list of named tuples, where these named tuples contains the ``.url``
        and the ``.response``, which is a ``aiohttp.ClientResponse`` or a
        ``aiohttp.ClientError`` object.
